# PROJECT IDEAS

- Some type of blog where you can post about a restaurant or latestfood you ate and others can comment on your post - similar to yelp. (another version of this would be a page with a collection of recipes that you can favorite or add your own recipes and people can sign in and create a collection of their own recipes as well as comment on users posts. Possible need to use a recipe API?)

- Travel Blog similar to the above idea that includes places visited, what to do there, etc.., and people can recommend things to do.

- A music review page that connects to Youtube or Spotify where people can sign in and share or talk about music they're currently listenening to.
