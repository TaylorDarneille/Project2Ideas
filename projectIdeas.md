# PROJECT IDEAS

- Some type of blog where you can post about a restaurant or latestfood you ate and others can comment on your post - similar to yelp. (another version of this would be a page with a collection of recipes that you can favorite or add your own recipes and people can sign in and create a collection of their own recipes as well as comment on users posts. Possibly need to use a recipe API? - still looking for one
* Site concept: A way to stay connected through food. Share recipes and add your own!

- User stories 

* User needs to be able to login to access recipes/add their own recipes/add comments
* User needs to be able to navigate between homepage, favorited recipes, and comments (nagivation bar)
* User needs to be able to have the option to add their own recipes to the site
* User needs to be able to comment on other peoples recipes/favorited recipes

- Travel Blog similar to the above idea that includes places visited, what to do there, etc.., and people can recommend things to do. Possibly using the Mapbox API

- A music review page that connects to Youtube or Spotify where people can sign in and share or talk about music they're currently listenening to.
