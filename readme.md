Fork & Clone this repo.

## Part 1

Review the [Project 2 requirements](https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/sei-ga-sea/11-projects/project-2#project-feedback-evaluation) and check out some [examples](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/sei-ga-sea/11-projects/past-projects/project2&sa=D&source=calendar&ust=1597596784944000&usg=AOvVaw1ihTzKFunxKsL2f6sIYdlC).

In this space below, list **THREE** ideas for your Project 2. For each idea, include [user stories](https://revelry.co/user-stories-that-dont-suck/) for each idea and a link to the API(s) you want to use for it.

1. California Covid Tracker. I want to make a beautiful, digestible, and easy to use site for all things Covid-19 in California so that it can be accessible to users of all ages,abilities and technical background.

2. Feel Better Website. I want to provide a site that affirms people by providing them words that can encourage and brighten up their day. 
There is a bible API that connects bible verses to current events. I want to connect that with an affirmation API that says nice things to you.

3. Air Jordan Sneaker Release Tracker. I want to scrape the sneakernews website (already checked if it's doable) and combine that with the Sneaker Database in order to create an updated release calender for upcoming sneaker drops. This will be combined with the Sneaker Database API in order to provide history on older versions and more information on sizing and whatnot.

## Part 2

In the space below:

### ERD

----------------------------------------------------------
### User Stories
I want to create a beautiful and simple website for users to track upcoming Jordan sneaker releases. As of this moment, there are no API's for this so I plan one
scraping the release information from sneaker websites. I want to tie in the Sneaker Database API to provide history about the shoes being released (since most of 
them are reoccuring shoes with different colorways), how to buy them, and images of people wearing them.
