# Project 2 Planning

Fork & Clone this repo.

## Part 1

In this space below, list **THREE** ideas for your Project 2. For each idea, include [user stories](https://revelry.co/user-stories-that-dont-suck/) for each idea and a link to the API(s) you want to use for it.

--------------------------------------------------------
It was difficult for me to zone in on just one idea, I came across so many cool APIs.. but for the full RESTful experience there weren't too many that I was interested in where it made sense to PUT or DELETE something. 

I did find one API though where I think might be appropriate for it. So this app will be for all those that enjoy alcohol to some extent, and will be looking to experiment and be adventurous with new ones. It's going to be a guide (cookbook like) but for making drinks. It will list the ingredients to make a concoction along with a name and a picture to with it for a full blown drunken experience afterward. 

The idea is mainly to have a guide be able to make the cocktail, but there will also be a way to save your favorites, and there will be a forum of some sort where EDIT/DELETE will come into play for those who maybe want to leave a review about the drink, or need help from someone because somehow they don't know how to measure properly to make a perfect drink.

Also if you've experimented enough with different ingredients and made a signature drink of your own, you should be able to add it to the database!

## Part 2

In the space below:
* either embed or link a completed ERD for your approved P2 idea

* if there are any changes/additions to your user stories, place your full set of revised user stories here

* either embed or link wireframes for every page of your app

----------------------------------------------------------
### ERD
Need help with it, have some confusion on relations. Will add after some clarification
----------------------------------------------------------
### User Stories
1. I should be able to search for a drink by name, or ingredient.
2. I want to be able to save my favorite drinks to a list, and be able to access them later.
3. I should be able to talk to other people about how they perfected their drink. 
4. I need to be able to ask others for help from other alcoholics because I don't know how to do basic trial and error without getting drunk from constantly tasting it.
5. Since I lost my job due to the pandemic, I want there to be some sort of fun " random drink of the day" thing to cheer me up on this website that will choose a drink randomly.
6. If I have a drink I want to share with the world, I want to be able to add it!
