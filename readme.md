Fork & Clone this repo.

## Part 1

Review the [Project 2 requirements](https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/seirfx/11-projects/project-2#project-feedback-evaluation) and check out some [examples](https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/seirfx/11-projects/past-projects/project2).

In this space below, list **THREE** ideas for your Project 2. For each idea, include [user stories](https://revelry.co/user-stories-that-dont-suck/) for each idea and a link to the API(s) you want to use for it.

--------------------------------------------------------
1. 
2. Hiking App pull data from AllTrail or Postman API
3. I have successfully recieved data from the API I found and it's pretty cool because I can filter my results to the 
specific area that I want to focus on, which is the White Mountains. I'd really like to try to make this idea work for my project 2.
