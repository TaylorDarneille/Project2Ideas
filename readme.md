# Project 2 Planning

Fork & Clone this repo.

## Part 1

Review the [Project 2 requirements](https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/seirfx/11-projects/project-2#project-feedback-evaluation) and check out some [examples](https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/seirfx/11-projects/past-projects/project2).

In this space below, list **THREE** ideas for your Project 2. For each idea, include [user stories](https://revelry.co/user-stories-that-dont-suck/) for each idea and a link to the API(s) you want to use for it.

--------------------------------------------------------
1. Halo Gamplay & Strategy Planner: User can create a profile, acess their player stats, add their friends and view frienda stats, learn about the game's weapons and maps and save selected options to be able to create a gamplay strategy based on the advantages and disadvantages of each option and the player(s) strengths and weaknesses. Models include a User model, Friends model, Stats model, Saved Weapon model, Saved Map model, and Stategies. Halo API is here: https://developer.haloapi.com/docs/services/

2. Extra-Income Tracker: app for people who take on side-gigs for cash from posting jobs or services on sites like FB marketplace or Craigslist, or independent contractor jobs like Doordash. User can list as side-jobs as they want, track income, expenses, log hours, and save client information. Would use fb messenger's Send API (https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-messages) to access all the FB marketplace replies to your posting under one spot, vs getting mixed in with your regular fb messages. Couldnt find APIs for craigslist seller, so this and other jobs like doordash would have that functionality. Models include: User table, Job Types table, Entries Table, and Customers Table
