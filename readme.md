Fork & Clone this repo.

## Part 1

Review the [Project 2 requirements](https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/sei-ga-sea/11-projects/project-2#project-feedback-evaluation) and check out some [examples](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/sei-ga-sea/11-projects/past-projects/project2&sa=D&source=calendar&ust=1597596784944000&usg=AOvVaw1ihTzKFunxKsL2f6sIYdlC).

In this space below, list **THREE** ideas for your Project 2. For each idea, include [user stories](https://revelry.co/user-stories-that-dont-suck/) for each idea and a link to the API(s) you want to use for it.

--------------------------------------------------------
1. Some type of blog where you can post about a restaurant or latestfood you ate and others can comment on your post - similar to yelp. (another version of this would be a page with a collection of recipes that you can favorite or add your own recipes and people can sign in and create a collection of their own recipes as well as comment on users posts. Possibly need to use a recipe API? - still looking for one
* Site concept: A way to stay connected through food. Share recipes and add your own!

### User stories 

* User needs to be able to login to access recipes/add their own recipes/add comments
* User needs to be able to navigate between homepage, favorited recipes, and comments (nagivation bar)
* User needs to be able to have the option to add their own recipes to the site
* User needs to be able to comment on other peoples recipes/favorited recipes

2. Travel Blog similar to the above idea that includes places visited, what to do there, etc.., and people can recommend things to do. Possibly using the Mapbox API

3. A music review page that connects to Youtube or Spotify where people can sign in and share or talk about music they're currently listenening to.
