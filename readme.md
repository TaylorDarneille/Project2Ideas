### User Stories
As a gamer, I want to look at the details about each weapon available on the map in each of the game modes in Halo so I can compare differences and decide which weapons are best to use.
As a gamer, I want to be able to compare my strengths & weaknesses with my teammates and my opponents so I can plan a better strategy against other teams.
As a gamer, I want to know how to win each match depending on the combination of the game mode, the map, and the available weapons. Added bonus if I can get the locations of each weapon's spawn-point on the maps. 
As a gamer, I want to save, edit, and delete specific map & weapon combos so I can test out the variations in gameplay.
