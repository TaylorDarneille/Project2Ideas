# Project 2 Planning

Fork & Clone this repo.

## Part 1

Review the [Project 2 requirements](https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/seirfx/11-projects/project-2#project-feedback-evaluation) and check out some [examples](https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/seirfx/11-projects/past-projects/project2).

In this space below, list **THREE** ideas for your Project 2. For each idea, include [user stories](https://revelry.co/user-stories-that-dont-suck/) for each idea and a link to the API(s) you want to use for it.

--------------------------------------------------------
1. Music search/save albums: allows a user to search for albums and save them to a favorites library, can then click on an album to see more information. Spotify API - I think I'm close to understanding how to make a call? Requires making authentication calls, using tokens, receiving refresh tokens with each response.

USER STORIES:
I want to log in and view my library
I want to search for either an artist or album name and see a list of results
I want to add albums to my library with one click
I want to see an artist's albums if I click on their search result
I want to see detailed metadata for albums in my library if I click on them
I want to be able to remove albums from my library

2. Synthesizer presets: use Tone.js to allow users to pick synthesizer presets from a menu, save them, and choose from their presets to play a given melodic sequence

https://tonejs.github.io/

I want to use a 'new preset' screen with some buttons/drop down menus to choose from available settings (waveforms, effects, filters, etc.)
I want to save the choices I've made
I want to choose from my presets to hear how they sound


3. I spent so much time this week trying to figure out html audio and Tone.js with not much success that I sadly do not have a third idea yet
