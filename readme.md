### User Stories
* If a user visits the website, they should first be routed to the login page. 
* If the user is already a member they will enter their user name and password to enter the site
* If the user is not a member they will be routed to a sign up page to enter in desired username, email and password in order to create account; will then be routed back to * *   login page to log in
* If a user is logged in successfully they should see the main item catalog page with all items listed(newest to oldest); there will also be an icon to view their profile on * *   every page hereafter.
* If a user would like to add an item to their list they can click the add icon
* If the user would like to learn more about the item the user can click on the item photo and is routed to the item page
* If a user visits an item page they can see an item bio, item type bio, and an add item icon to add item to their list.
* If a user would like to see their page they can click on the user profile icon which routes them to their user profile page.
* From the user profile page, a user can view their set up lists, open a set up list, delete a set up list, or can select to view thier blog from the blog icon.
* If a user selects to open a set up list they will be routed to a page that shows all the items in that given list.
* If a user selects to go to their blog, they will be routed to a blog page where they can create a blog post which gets sent directly to their medium profile.
