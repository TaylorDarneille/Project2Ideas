* either embed or link a completed ERD for your approved P2 idea

### User Stories
As a user I want to be able to:

1. Create an account on CurrencyDesk and search through 50+ different countries and their currency's exchange rate from USD (U.S. Dollars)
2. Select a currency & country and view the exchange rate from USD to the currency of the country I am traveling to.
3. Save different countrie's currencys to a favorites page so that I can view them later for when I travel to that country.
